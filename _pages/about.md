I am currently working as an **Applied Research Engineer** in **AI/ML** at **Company XYZ**, where I focus on cutting-edge research and development in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. Previously, I completed my **Master of Science (by Research)** in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). During my time there, I was affiliated with the Sudha Gopalakrishnan Brain Centre ([SGBC-IITM](https://public.humanbrain.in/public/)) Lab, under the expert guidance of [Prof. Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/mohan/). My research focused on **Biomedical Image Processing**, particularly in **Registration and Segmentation**, emphasizing applying these techniques to large-scale datasets.

Before my postgraduate studies, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from [B.M.S. College of Engineering](https://www.bmsce.ac.in/), which provided a strong foundation for my academic and professional pursuits.
